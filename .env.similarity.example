# HA-RAG Bridge Similarity Threshold Configuration
# =================================================

# Current optimized thresholds for paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2
# These values are automatically set based on your model, but can be overridden

# EXCELLENT threshold - Only the most relevant results (high confidence)
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLENT=0.88

# GOOD threshold - Relevant results (good confidence)  
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_GOOD=0.75

# ACCEPTABLE threshold - May be relevant (moderate confidence)
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_ACCEPTABLE=0.52

# MINIMUM threshold - Filter out irrelevant results (low confidence cutoff)
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_MINIMUM=0.45

# ==========================================
# Advanced Configuration Options
# ==========================================

# Override automatic model detection
# SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2"

# Force specific backend
# EMBEDDING_BACKEND=local

# CPU optimization for embedding
# EMBEDDING_CPU_THREADS=4

# ==========================================
# Alternative Model Recommendations
# ==========================================

# FOR BETTER SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:
# SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2"
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLENT=0.85
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_GOOD=0.70
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_ACCEPTABLE=0.50
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_MINIMUM=0.40

# FOR MAXIMUM SPEED (current model is already fast):
# SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLENT=0.90
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_GOOD=0.80
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_ACCEPTABLE=0.60
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_MINIMUM=0.50

# ==========================================
# Usage Examples
# ==========================================

# Example 1: More strict matching (higher precision, fewer results)
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLENT=0.92
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_GOOD=0.85
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_ACCEPTABLE=0.70

# Example 2: More lenient matching (higher recall, more results)
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLENT=0.80
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_GOOD=0.65
# SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_ACCEPTABLE=0.45

# Example 3: Debug mode (see what thresholds are being used)
# Check http://your-server/similarity-config for current values

# ==========================================
# Performance Impact
# ==========================================

# Higher thresholds = Fewer, more relevant results = Less LLM processing
# Lower thresholds = More results, some less relevant = More LLM processing

# The system automatically adjusts thresholds based on query type:
# - Control queries ("turn on lights") use higher thresholds
# - Status queries ("what's the temperature") use lower thresholds

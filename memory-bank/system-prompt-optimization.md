# System Prompt Optimization for Cache-Friendly LLM Interaction

## Overview

This document outlines the optimized system prompt strategy implemented for the Home Assistant RAG system, designed to maximize LLM cache efficiency while providing intelligent, contextual responses.

## Problem

Traditional approaches embed dynamic content (entity states, current values) directly in the system prompt, which changes with every request. This prevents effective caching in local LLMs like Mistral, leading to:
- Slower response times due to repeated system prompt processing
- Higher memory usage as KV-cache cannot be reused
- Reduced throughput for concurrent requests

## Solution: Cache-Friendly Architecture

### Static System Prompt (Always Cached)

```
You are an intelligent home assistant AI with deep understanding of your user's home environment.

**Your Capabilities:**
- Answer questions about home status, device states, and environmental conditions  
- Control smart home devices through available services
- Provide proactive insights and recommendations
- Understand context from previous conversations

**Response Guidelines:**
- Be concise but informative - avoid unnecessary explanations
- When controlling devices, confirm the action taken  
- For status queries, provide current values with context (e.g., "Living room is 22.5°C, which is comfortable")
- If multiple entities are relevant, prioritize the most important ones
- For Hungarian queries, respond in Hungarian; for English queries, respond in English
- When you don't have enough information, ask specific clarifying questions

**Smart Reasoning:**
- Consider relationships between entities (e.g., if heating is on but windows are open)
- Provide seasonal or time-appropriate context when relevant
- Suggest energy-saving or comfort optimizations when appropriate

Help the user efficiently and naturally, as if you truly understand their home.

### Dynamic Context in User Message

The variable home context (entity states, current values) is provided in the user message:

```
Current home context:
[Dynamic entity states, formatted by cluster-based system]

User question: [Actual user query]
```

## Implementation Details

### Message Structure
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": STATIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT},  # Cacheable
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Current home context:\n{entity_context}\n\nUser question: {user_query}"}  # Dynamic
]
```

### Integration with Cluster-Based RAG

The system works seamlessly with the cluster-based entity retrieval:

1. **Query Scope Detection**: Determines appropriate detail level (micro/macro/overview)
2. **Cluster Search**: Finds semantically relevant entity clusters
3. **Adaptive Formatting**: Formats entities using scope-appropriate formatter
4. **Context Injection**: Injects formatted context into user message
5. **Static Prompt**: Uses cached system prompt for consistent AI behavior

## Performance Benefits

### Cache Efficiency
- **High Cache Hit Rate**: System prompt never changes, allowing perfect KV-cache reuse
- **Reduced Processing**: Mistral skips system prompt processing after first request
- **Memory Optimization**: Shared KV-cache across similar queries

### Response Quality
- **Contextual Intelligence**: AI still receives all necessary home context
- **Consistent Behavior**: Static prompt ensures predictable AI personality
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic Hungarian/English detection and response

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple users share cached system prompt processing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower CPU and memory usage per request
- **Faster Throughput**: Reduced latency especially for follow-up questions

## Comparison with Previous Approach

| Aspect | Old (Dynamic System) | New (Cache-Friendly) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Cache Hit Rate | ~0% (always different) | ~95% (static system) |
| Processing Time | Full prompt each time | System cached, only user processed |
| Memory Usage | High (unique KV per request) | Low (shared KV-cache) |
| Context Quality | Same | Same |
| AI Consistency | Same | Improved (static personality) |

## Examples

### Solar Performance Query
**Static System Prompt**: [Cached - processed once]

**User Message**:
```
Current home context:
Primary entity: sensor.solar_power [inverter]
Current value: 2.1 kW

Related entities:
- sensor.battery_level [inverter]: 85%
- sensor.daily_energy [inverter]: 18.5 kWh

User question: Hogy termel a napelem?
```

### Multi-Entity Status Query
**Static System Prompt**: [Cached - reused]

**User Message**:
```
Current home context:
Entities by area:

nappali:
- sensor.living_temp: 22.5°C
- light.living_main: off
- climate.living_ac: auto (target: 23°C)

konyha:
- sensor.kitchen_temp: 24.1°C  
- light.kitchen_main: on

User question: Mi a helyzet otthon?
```

## Best Practices

### System Prompt Design
- Keep instructions general and context-independent
- Focus on behavior, personality, and response formatting
- Avoid any dynamic content or current state references

### Context Formatting
- Structure dynamic context clearly in user message
- Use consistent formatting that the AI can easily parse
- Include relevant relationships and current values

### Testing Cache Efficiency
- Monitor LLM response times for repeated similar queries
- Verify KV-cache utilization in local Mistral deployment
- Test concurrent request performance

## Future Enhancements

### Template-Based Optimization
For even better cache efficiency, consider grouping similar context patterns:
- Cache templates for common entity count patterns
- Reuse formatting templates across similar queries
- Pre-compute context structures for frequent use cases

### Dynamic System Extensions
If system-level context becomes necessary:
- Use system message templates with placeholder slots
- Cache template variations rather than fully dynamic content
- Implement cache warming strategies for common patterns

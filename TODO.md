# TODO - HA-RAG Bridge Development Tasks

## 🚀 High Priority Features

### Stream-based Metrics System (Admin UI)
**Priority:** High | **Status:** Planned | **Estimate:** 2-3 days

**Problem:** Current 5-second polling causes UI flickering and excessive network overhead

**Solution:** EventSource-based real-time metrics streaming

#### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Create `/admin/monitoring/metrics/stream` SSE endpoint
- [ ] Implement `psutil` integration for real CPU/memory data
- [ ] Add response time tracking middleware
- [ ] Create QPS counter with sliding window
- [ ] Add configurable streaming interval (1-10s)
- [ ] Implement proper async metrics collection

#### Frontend Tasks  
- [ ] Replace useQuery polling with EventSource connection
- [ ] Add automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement smooth chart transitions (CSS animations)
- [ ] Add stream control UI (start/stop, interval selection)
- [ ] Use Page Visibility API for background pause
- [ ] Optimize React chart rendering with React.memo

#### Performance Goals
- 60-80% reduction in network requests
- Sub-second real-time updates
- Smooth UX without flickering
- Support for multiple concurrent clients

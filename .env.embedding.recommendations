# Embedding Model Comparison and Recommendations
# ================================================

# Current model analysis results:
# - Speed: Excellent (257 texts/sec)
# - Multilingual: Excellent (0.918)
# - Semantic accuracy: Poor (44.4%)
# - Memory usage: Good (8.9GB/16GB)

# RECOMMENDED UPGRADES (in order of preference):

# 1. BEST BALANCE - Better semantic understanding
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="all-mpnet-base-v2"
# - Dimension: 768 (better quality)
# - Memory: ~1.2GB
# - Speed: Slightly slower but still fast
# - Semantic accuracy: Significantly better

# 2. MULTILINGUAL UPGRADE - Keep multilingual but better quality  
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2"
# - Dimension: 768
# - Memory: ~1.5GB
# - Multilingual: Maintained
# - Semantic accuracy: Much better

# 3. DOMAIN SPECIALIZED - For technical/IoT content
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1"
# - Dimension: 768
# - Better with technical terms
# - Good balance

# 4. IF SPEED IS CRITICAL - Keep current but tune thresholds
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL="paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2"
# - Adjust similarity thresholds in search
# - Current model, tuned usage

# Performance comparison (estimated):
# Current:     Speed=Excellent, Quality=Poor,      Memory=Low
# mpnet-base:  Speed=Good,      Quality=Excellent, Memory=Medium  
# multilingual-mpnet: Speed=Good, Quality=Excellent, Memory=Medium, Multilingual=Yes
# distilroberta: Speed=Good,    Quality=Good,      Memory=Medium, Technical=Better
